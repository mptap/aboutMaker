About Maker | K.I.T.E. Nagpur, India 2012

The course-end projects at KITE, are to be completed in the time limit of 8 hours. 
The students also have to write code that displays the name of their project, their own names, college details, etc. 
This coding takes, on an average, half an hour out of those 8 hours. 
The present project reduces that coding time to one minute. 
The project consists of three modules, viz., client, server, and a frame-designer module. 
The server would be running on one host; the project students working on different hosts would enter their data through client module running on their host. 
The server would collect this data and segregate it project-wise into different data files. 
Using such a file, the frame-designer module would create a frame class, whose object would show the project details in a neatly-designed frame.
If your browser is Java-enabled, you should see a button titled 'Project Metadata' in the left column. 
On clicking that button, you would see the frame showing details of the students who have done this project.
